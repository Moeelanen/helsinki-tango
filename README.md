This is an image created from the map data used for the game. Map data is exported from OpenStreetMap, and made into a machine readable graph format with [OsmRoadToGraph](https://github.com/AndGem/OsmToRoadGraph). All of the map related data - with the exception of the .osm file - can be viewed in their respective folder.
